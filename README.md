# Emulation of a Simplified Scheduling Policy Based on Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) Using Threads

### Purpose

This project emulates a simplified scheduling policy based on the Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) using threads. It demonstrates how to implement thread scheduling using the basic principles of CFS.

### How to Run the Program

1.  **Clone/Download the Code**: Ensure that all the files are in the same directory.

2.  **Run the Shell Script**: First, execute the script file to compile the code.

    ```bash
    ./script.sh

    ```

3.  **Run the Scheduler**: Once the code is compiled, execute the following command to run the program:

    ```
        ./scheduler

    ```

    This will start the simplified scheduling process. The output in the terminal as the program executes each process based on the simplified CFS scheduler. The output will include detailed information about the processes being executed, such as process ID, priority updates, and execution times.
